"Now, if that sounds insanely simple, that's because it is. So check it out: Hakim, a former barber, now teaches barbers how to cut hair. He makes over $16,000 a month in recurring revenue and was able to retire his mom from his online community. Levi and his partner from Music Money VIP helped musicians and creatives learn the business of making money. They take over $30,000 a month from that community. Evelyn gained 234 members in her first month in the school games organically, just from the millions of users we already have on school. Christian simply teaches people how to flip phones and then was able to make a phone flipping community. Kai created a YouTube community helping other YouTubers make better thumbnails and headlines. This is the first time he's ever even made an offer, and he's earning over $57,000 a month after his first school games."
