# 1. Hook and Pain Point Identification
Have you ever looked at yourself in the mirror and thought, "Wow, I should be further ahead by now"? If you're trying to make money online or start your first business and feel overwhelmed, you're not alone. Every day, you see other people succeeding, and you wonder, "Why am I not succeeding?" Maybe you don't like your job, or you're unfulfilled. You want to do something you love and make money, but you feel stuck, bored, confused, or maybe all three.

# 2. Presenter's Credibility and Relatability
I get it. I spent years in the exact same spot, afraid to fail, but ashamed of being afraid. And it wasn't until I paid another business owner to teach me how to run a local business that I felt comfortable starting my own. He showed me the ropes and gave me the confidence to start. After scaling my local gym chain from learning this stuff from him, I started a company called Gym Launch, which I sold years later for $46.2 million.

# 3. Introduction to the Solution
Now, what I want to do is repay the favor. I want to show you the ropes the exact way that business owner did for me. And as the person with the largest community-owned school, which I'll tell you about in a second, I can show you exactly what to do. You can start your own online community business today with all the things I didn't know when I started my first business for free with the school games.

# 4. Explanation of the Product/Service
School games is a fun, easy way to build your online business. No experience or followers needed. Just simply choose a painful experience you overcame, something you find interesting or you're passionate about, or some skill you learned throughout your career. No matter how small. It could be as simple as a better way to organize folders, or meal prepping for kids who have food allergies, or travel hacks. And then all you have to do is just invite people to a community about overcoming that pain, following that passion, or learning that skill. And we'll show you exactly how to build it and monetize it on your first try.

# 5. Social Proof and Success Stories
Now, if that sounds insanely simple, that's because it is. So check it out:

- Hakim, a former barber, now teaches barbers how to cut hair. He makes over $16,000 a month in recurring revenue and was able to retire his mom from his online community.
- Levi and his partner from Music Money VIP helped musicians and creatives learn the business of making money. They take over $30,000 a month from that community.
- Evelyn gained 234 members in her first month in the school games organically, just from the millions of users we already have on school.
- Christian simply teaches people how to flip phones and then was able to make a phone flipping community.
- Kai created a YouTube community helping other YouTubers make better thumbnails and headlines. This is the first time he's ever even made an offer, and he's earning over $57,000 a month after his first school games.
- Nate and his brother are really into anime and fitness. So they created a community to help people do anime and fitness together and become their own heroes. They did $91,000 in recurring revenue their first month.
- Kenneth started Credit Printers, a community that helps people improve their credit scores.

# 6. Addressing Objections and Building Confidence
And here's the thing. You can become one of these success stories. You want to know why I say that so confidently? Because 54.1% of people who started a paid community in school make money. Yes, you heard that right. More than one out of two people who start a paid community in school make money. That means, by your next reunion, instead of answering, "What are you up to these days?" You could be answering, "How'd you do that?" And, "Could you help me?" And the thing is, you probably could because it's not that hard.

# 7. Simplifying the Concept
So think about a paid community like this. It's kind of like an online party. When people go to a party, it's not the host that makes the party. It's the other people at the party. The host just invites the guests, provides the place to meet, and sets the rules for the party. And since it's your party, you can make the place seem whatever you want, and invite whoever you want. And when the party rocks, you get all the credit, even though you just put it together. And when the doorman collects the money to let people in, it all goes to you.

# 8. Creating Urgency and FOMO
Right now, people are paying hundreds, sometimes thousands, to get into digital communities the same way they do nightclubs or cafes. Just think about it as a place where lots of people who want to talk about the same stuff can gather together, and people pay to get in. And the crazy thing is, people are selling courses and coaching programs for thousands, and tens of thousands, on how to build a business like this, because it's so profitable.

# 9. Unique Selling Proposition
But what if there were a faster, easier, zero-risk way to learn how to do this for yourself? What if you could learn how to start, scale, and monetize an online group the right way, on your first try, for free? Would you at least consider it?

# 10. Overcoming Obstacles and Addressing Concerns
Interested yet? Good. Because school games was designed to smash through every obstacle that once stood in the way of starting an online business. It's why we have such an insanely high success rate. We've obsessed for years about removing everything that stops people from succeeding. And that's why with the school games, you can succeed without an audience or expertise. Because, let's face it, most people don't. And so we had to figure out a way to help people win.
