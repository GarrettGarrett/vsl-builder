Example of an ideal paragraph (use as inspiration, do not copy directly):
"So think about a paid community like this. It's kind of like an online party. When people go to a party, it's not the host that makes the party. It's the other people at the party. The host just invites the guests, provides the place to meet, and sets the rules for the party. And since it's your party, you can make the place seem whatever you want, and invite whoever you want. And when the party rocks, you get all the credit, even though you just put it together. And when the doorman collects the money to let people in, it all goes to you."
